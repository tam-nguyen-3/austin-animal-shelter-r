## Questions addressed
- What is the shelter's expected revenue, given information about the fees for each type of animal? 
- How should the shelter distribute its portion of cages to cats and dogs given the estimated length of stay for each, assumming that the shelter has limited capacity?
- What is the timeframe that the shelter and adopters should be concerned about the fading kitten syndrome?
- Given known information about volunteering hours and capacity, how many volunteers should the shelter take on?
